## Roadmap
### Inspiration & Solutions
- Broad application of artificial intelligence in current education.
- Our goal is to create a modern, efficient, and comprehensive educational platform powered by AI that meets the diverse needs of students.
The project is inspired by several urgent and ongoing issues that students face today:
1. Aimless Use of Social Media
+ According to a recent survey, Vietnamese youth spend an average of 7 hours per day on social media. (Source: abei.gov.vn)
+ The standout features of current social networks are their speed and abundance of information, but this content is often mixed with both good and bad information and lacks direction. (...) With their appealing features, these platforms can easily trap users in a chaotic “sea of information,” leading to distraction from studies, decreased productivity, mental stress, and a deep dive into the virtual world. (Source: hatinh.dcs.vn)
⇒ Solution & Feature: Newsfeed: Stay on trend with Gen Z and generate high-quality content by building a social network focused on educational, trendy, and entertaining content. This way, self-study time won’t feel restrictive—students can both enjoy themselves and gain new knowledge.
2. Ineffective Studying and Teamwork
+ There's a lack of an efficient group meeting platform for students to form study groups, share ideas, manage tasks, monitor progress, etc. (It needs to be organized, secure, flexible, and user-friendly.)
+ Poor focus. 
+ Struggles with time management, prioritization, and setting achievable goals. 
⇒ Solution & Feature: Study Room (Small Group Virtual Study Spaces)
Allows students to create small-group virtual study spaces with friends or even strangers. These groups include emotion-tracking features to monitor learners’ emotional states, and use AI to provide helpful advice. Above all, we want to spark curiosity and foster genuine enjoyment of learning, rather than just tracking how many hours someone is seated at a desk.
3. Online Answers Don't Help Students Truly Understand?
Many websites provide answers to exercises but often without clear or complete explanations. Students get the answers but don’t fully grasp the material, leading to ineffective learning.
⇒ Solution: Homework Q&A with Chatbot
Provides answers to questions with detailed explanations and supports conversations with a chatbot. This helps students not only understand the content but also learn how to effectively apply AI in their studies.
### Current Features
1. Use of AI to detect students’ emotional states.
2. Creation of virtual study rooms for collaborative learning.
### Features in Development
1. A section dedicated to shared learning tips and knowledge.
2. Chatbot integration in study rooms for Q&A.
3. Personalized categorization of study rooms.

### Things To do

- [x] Inital Landing Page
- [x] Enable Video Feed
- [x] Real Time Emotion Analysis using TensorFlow
- [x] Adding Models from face-api
- [x] Add Static Analysis of a picture

"To Infinity and Beyond" recognizes the importance of problem-solving, continuous innovation, and product improvement. After advancing past Round 2 and entering the first stage of Round 3, the next plan is to conduct more in-depth user research. Specifically, we will roll out the product on a small scale, conduct surveys to collect data, and evaluate students’ satisfaction and preferences. From there, we’ll identify unresolved issues and further improve the product. Secondly, we’ll continue to develop and enhance features. The team will create categorized study rooms (by topic, subject, etc.) to help students easily find suitable groups to study with. Currently, the platform is being developed for the web, and the team hopes to have more opportunities to improve and optimize its functions and learning tools. Eventually, we plan to launch a mobile app version to expand access to a wider range of users.
